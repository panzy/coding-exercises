1191. K-Concatenation Maximum Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/k-concatenation-maximum-sum/

Given an integer array arr and an integer k, modify the array by repeating it k times.

For example, if arr = [1, 2] and k = 3 then the modified array will be [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2].

Return the maximum sub-array sum in the modified array. Note that the length of the sub-array can be 0 and its sum in that case is 0.

As the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo 109 + 7.

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 105
1 <= k <= 105
-104 <= arr[i] <= 104
