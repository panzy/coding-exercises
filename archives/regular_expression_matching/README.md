# 10. Regular Expression Matching

https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/

Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

'.' Matches any single character.

'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

## Notes

I was somewhat prepared for wrong-answer rejections, but didn't expect
I had to submit 7 times to finally get accepted.

The hard thing about this problem is that for each '*', how greedy should it be?

## TODO

My solution is too complicated.
