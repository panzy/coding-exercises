Given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.

You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. Notice that you can only attend one event at any time d.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

Constraints:

1 <= events.length <= 10^5
events[i].length == 2
1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^5
