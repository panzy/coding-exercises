665. Non-decreasing Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-array/

Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 10^4
-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
