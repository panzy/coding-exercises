Suppose you have n integers from 1 to n. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these n numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the i-th position (1 <= i <= n) in this array:

The number at the i-th position is divisible by i.
i is divisible by the number at the i-th position.
Given an integer n, return the number of the beautiful arrangements that you can construct.
