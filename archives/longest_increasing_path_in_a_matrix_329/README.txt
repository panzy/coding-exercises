329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/

Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 2^31 - 1
