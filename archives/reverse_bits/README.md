# 190. Reverse Bits

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/submissions/

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

## Notes

It's easy to solve. At least, one can reverse those bits as if they
were in an array. However, there are several advanced, tricky approaches.
For instance, I didn't know one can reverse a byte's bits with merely some calculations.
