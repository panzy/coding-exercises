# 221. Maximal Square

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/)

Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

## Notes

This problem is related to problem [85. Maximal Rectangle](../maximal_rectangle)
and is supposed to be less hard. I turned the solution to the latter into an
accepted one by merely changing the definition of rectangle area.
