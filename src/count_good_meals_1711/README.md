- [1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs](../max_number_of_k_sum_pairs_1679)

Although for a given number, there are infinite number of others that can
pair with this number and result in a power of two, we can make rules to
limit the possibilities. Then this problem becomes very similar to the
k-sum one (except that in this problem, a number is allowed to be used
in different pairs).
