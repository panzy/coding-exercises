# 433. Minimum Genetic Mutation

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/

## Notes

This question is identical to [127. Word Ladder](../word_ladder),
except the constraints. In Word Ladder, the word list's size can be as large
as 5000. Maybe that's why this problem is considered medium difficult while
Word Ladder is hard.
