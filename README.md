# Coding Exercises

My workspace for coding exercises.

Most of the problems being solved are from LeetCode.

Solutions usually come with unit tests, and optionally some thoughts and illustrations.

There are some utils in the `_lib` package.

Old code is dumped to `archives/` directory to free my IDE from loading too many files.
