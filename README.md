# LeetCode Solutions & Tests

Record my solutions to LeetCode questions.

All solutions come with unit tests.

There are some utils and generic algorithms in the `_lib` package.

Illustrations of tricky corner cases and core concepts are provided in some problems' README file,
for example, [Maximal Rectangle](./src/maximal_rectangle),
and [719. Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance](./src/find_kth_smallest_pair_distance).
