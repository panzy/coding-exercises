# Coding Exercises

My workspace for coding exercises.

## Directory Layout

### src/util/

- small data structures like `Pair`, `ListNode`, `TreeNode`.
- helpers to facilitate testing, such as `TreeFactory` to build
a tree from an array, `IntArrays` to load array from JSON files,
  shuffle an array, and so on.
- code snippets like swapping `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`.
 
### src/data_structure/

Data structure implementations that
might be useful when solving new problems.

### src/algorithms/

Algorithms that solve common problems.

### archives/

Ad-hoc solutions to problems from LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.
Code is dumped here just for the sake of record.
